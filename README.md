# Progressive Mesh Reduction in OpenGL 2.1 - A Short Tutorial

Mesh reduction is performed to accelerate render and save memory when lowering the level of detail in a model is considered acceptable. For example, the model may be far from the observer, making rendering at its highest possible level of detail wasteful. For 3D printing, mesh reduction can reduce the amount of material that's required to produce the object and eliminate details that a particular printer may have no capacity to produce.  

A "progressive mesh" reduces a model's complexity by repeated use of an edge collapse algorithm,  [this paper by Hoppe](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/hoppe/pm.pdf) originally presented the concept. 

[Melax's method](http://dev.gameres.com/Program/Visual/3D/PolygonReduction.pdf) finds and collapses the edge that when eliminated affects the model's topology the least. Melax defines a criterion that eliminates the edge with highest coplanarity in the model.

## Edge collapse algorithm for progressive mesh reduction ##

 **1.** Select edge *uv* to collapse according to a criterion of lowest cost of loss of topology. 

![edge collapse.JPG](https://bitbucket.org/repo/krqkKE/images/475275936-edge%20collapse.JPG)
 
 Melax chooses to assign lowest cost of loss of topology to the edge uv that is  most highly coplanar. 
 
Cost of collapsing an edge = length of edge * curvature term determined by dot products of face normals

 To determine this "curvature term", we seek the triangle adjacent to vertex u that's furthest away from the other triangles that are along uv. 

 **2.** Remove triangles on the selected edge uv (u is going to be removed)
 
 **3.** Update the remaining triangles that used vertex u, to use vertex v instead.
 
 **4.** Remove vertex u.
